Your bitcoin++ ticket is here!


bitcoin++ is excited to welcome you to our second conference in Austin, Texas!

The attached ticket will get you into the conference for three days of workshops
 and 
talks from some of the best builders and thinkers in the bitcoin L2 space. You'l
l need 
it to check-in!

NOTE: If you still need a place to stay, we've got a short list of suggestions o
n the conference website (https://btcpp.dev#venue); I'd also really recommend th
e Hyatt which is pricey but a nice walk to the venue. Any hotel downtown should 
be great, or an Airbnb nearby.
