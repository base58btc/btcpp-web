This is the code for the bitcoin++ website. (Conference [Twitter](https://twitter.com/btcplusplus))

All of the configuration values live in a `config.toml` file, which is missing from this repo on purpose.


## Setup Dependencies

We use nix for this. Installs go + tailwindcss + air dependencies for Makefile.

```
	nix develop
```


## To run for development

```
	make dev-run
```


## To build

```
  make build
```


This will put all the files necessary to serve the site into `target/`

Note that the Github actions deployer uses Docker and isn't nix-aware, so for now you *must* make and check-in any CSS changes before deploying.

CSS updates are made automatically by `dev-run`, so this shouldn't be too hard.


## Deploy Testing

Currently, we deploy the app using Digital Ocean, using the `Dockerfile`. Sometimes it's useful to test building changes locally. For this, I'd recommend using the `doctl` app.

Instructions [here](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/build-locally/), but in brief.

```
doctl app dev build
```

Then follow the instructions to run.

FIXME: currently it picks up the config.toml file; remove this and use .env.


Let's add an example fixme!
